# The Durability of the Samsung Galaxy S7: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction
The Samsung Galaxy S7, released in 2016, remains a popular choice among smartphone users. However, one common concern that potential buyers often have is the device's durability. In this article, we will delve into the topic, examining the factors that contribute to the durability of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and providing an in-depth analysis of whether it breaks easily or not.

## Factors Affecting Durability
1. Build Quality: The Galaxy S7 features a metal frame and Gorilla Glass panels on the front and back, contributing to its sleek design. While these materials enhance the device's aesthetics, they may impact its durability. Glass panels are prone to cracking or shattering, especially if the device is dropped from a significant height.

2. Water and Dust Resistance: The Galaxy S7 is IP68 certified, offering protection against water and dust. This feature significantly improves the device's durability, as it can withstand immersion in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. However, it is important to note that water resistance does not guarantee complete protection against damage, especially if the device is subjected to extreme conditions or excessive pressure.

3. Impact Resistance: The Galaxy S7 is equipped with shock-absorbing materials and internal components designed to withstand impacts. Despite these measures, the device's durability can still be compromised if it experiences a severe impact or is dropped on a hard surface. The presence of a protective case can significantly mitigate the risk of damage from accidental drops.

## User Feedback and Reports
While the Galaxy S7 has received generally positive reviews, it is essential to consider user feedback and reports regarding its durability to gain a comprehensive understanding.

1. Screen Fragility: Some users have reported instances of the Galaxy S7's screen cracking or shattering after dropping the device. It is worth noting that glass panels are more susceptible to damage compared to devices with alternative materials like plastic or metal.

2. Water Damage: Although the Galaxy S7 is water-resistant, there have been reports of water damage occurring after exposure to water, particularly if the device's seals or ports are compromised. It is crucial to ensure that all ports and covers are securely closed before exposing the device to water.

3. Individual Usage Patterns: It is important to consider that the durability of a smartphone can vary based on individual usage patterns. Factors such as how frequently the device is dropped, the presence of a protective case, and the overall care taken by the user can significantly influence the device's lifespan.

## Tips for Enhancing Durability
To minimize the risk of damage to your Samsung Galaxy S7, consider the following tips:

1. Use a Protective Case: Investing in a high-quality protective case can provide an additional layer of protection against accidental drops and impacts.

2. Apply a Screen Protector: Applying a tempered glass screen protector can help safeguard the device's screen from scratches and minimize the risk of cracking or shattering upon impact.

3. Handle with Care: Avoid exposing the device to extreme temperatures, excessive pressure, or harsh environments that could compromise its water and dust resistance.

4. Regular Maintenance: Inspect the device's ports and seals periodically to ensure they are free from debris or damage. Clean the device using appropriate methods and avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials.

## Conclusion
While the Samsung Galaxy S7 offers a blend of style and functionality, its durability is subject to certain limitations. The device's build quality and water resistance contribute positively to its durability, but its glass panels and overall impact resistance may impact its susceptibility to damage. By following the recommended tips and exercising caution, users can enhance the longevity of their Galaxy S7 and minimize the risk of breakage.
